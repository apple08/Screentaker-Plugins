Screentaker-Plugins
===================

A collection of effects (plugins) for the Screentaker app on the Mac App Store.  Have an idea/suggestion?  Just open an issue.

##Glare

This effect is essentially like a layer in Photoshop, the glare is just added above the screenshot, which is sandwiched between the glare and the device.  This effect gives you a nice big image (1182x2144) that can easily be scaled down, or used at full quality.
